Deep learning is one of the hottest topics in artificial intelligence right now it's a technique used to train computers to mimic the human brain and in the past few years it has been used in the development of self-driving cars and even in Customer Support where a bot on the other side in medical care neural networks detect cancer cells and analyze MRI images to give detailed self- driving cars what seemed like science fiction. Deep learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the processing of information in the human brain and how it can be applied to a variety of fields from medical care to self-driving cars. Deep learning is a branch of computer science where the goal is to train a machine to do a task that is difficult for the human brain to do. Deep learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the training of machines to learn new tricks and tricks are learned by training them with lots of data. Deep learning is a branch of computer science that uses computers to learn from each other and learn from the world around us it's a branch that's been around for a long time but is now being applied to a whole range of applications from medical care to Customer Support. The BBC's science correspondents take a look at some of the most interesting technology stories of the past year, including the death of Google co-founder Sergey Brin.
