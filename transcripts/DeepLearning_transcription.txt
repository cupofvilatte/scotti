ever wondered how Google Translates an entire web page to a different language in a matter of seconds or your phone gallery groups images based on their location all of this is a product of deep learning but what exactly is deep learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning which in turn is a subset of official intelligence artificial intelligence is a technique that enables a machine to mimic human behavior machine learning is a technique to achieve AI through Al and finally deep learning is a type of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human brain in terms of deep learning where is called an artificial neural network let's understand deep learning better and how it's different from machine learning say we create a machine that could differentiate can tomatoes and cherries if done using machine learning we'd have to tell the machine the features based on which the two can be differentiated these features could be rise and the type of stem on them with deep learning on the other hand the features are picked out by the neural network without human intervention of course that Independence comes at the cost of having a much higher volume of data to train our machine now let's dive into the working of neural networks here we have three students each of them write down the digit 9 on a piece of paper notably they don't all write it identically the human brain can easily recognized digits but what if a computer had to recognize them that's where deep learning comes in here is a neural network trained to identify image of 28 * 28 pixels now that amounts to a total of 784 pixels neural network is where the information processing takes place each of the 784 pixels is fed to a neuron in the on the other hand we have the output layer with each neuron representing a digit with a players existing between them the information is transferred from one layer to another over connecting channels each of these has a value attached to it Vince is called a weighted Channel all neurons have a unique number associated with it called bias this bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs which is then applied to a function known as the activation function the result of the activation function determines if the every activated neuron passes on information to the following layers this continues up till the second last layer digit the weights and bias are continuously adjusted to produce a well-trained network so where is deep learning applied in Customer Support when most people converse with customer support agents the conversation seems so real they don't even realize that it's actually a bot on the other side in medical care neural networks detect cancer cells and analyze MRI images to give detailed self-driving cars what seemed like science fiction is now a reality Apple Tesla and Nissan are only a few of the companies put on self-driving cars so deep learning has a vast scope but it too faces some limitations the first is we discussed earlier is while deep learning is the most efficient way to deal with unstructured data a neural network requires a massive volume of data to train let's assume we do you have access to the necessary amount of data processing this is not within the capability of every machine and that brings us to our second limitation computational power training a neural network requires graphical processing units which have thousands of cores as compared to CPUs gpus are of course more expensive and finally we come down to training time deep neural networks take hours or even months the time increases with the amount of data and number of layers in the network so here's a short quiz for you arrange the following statements order to describe the working of a neural network a the bias is added B the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated C make neuron is activated D the result is fed to an activation function leave your answers in the comments section below three of you stand a chance Amazon vouchers so hurry some of the popular deep learning Frameworks include tensorflow Pi torch Keras deep learning 4J Cafe Microsoft cognitive toolkit considering the future predictions for deep learning and AI we seem to have only scratched the surface in fact Horace techn is working on a device for the blind that uses deep learning with computer vision to describe the world to the users replicating the human mind at the entirety not just an episode of Science Fiction for too long the future is indeed full of surprises and that is deep learning for you in short if you enjoy this video do you like and share it also subscribe to our Channel if you haven't yet as we have a lot more exciting videos coming up fun learning till
