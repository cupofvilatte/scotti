I barely see your ship from here today I can't I'm wishful thinking I lied I dreamed your ship was thinking and I tremble thinking of you Cast Away I barely hear the sea this evening it's windy and you promised you'd be back I trust your word your warmth I miss your breathing but I will leave in case you choose to not come back dear sister it's been years since I've been waiting I wished you back so much that here you are my Anvil Shore my seashell in my vessel I barely see the land now from afar
